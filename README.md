# Counter Strike Global Offensive alias file generator
  
Simple program that searches the config files in the given folder for alias  
definition and generates a new config file which echos all the aliases.  
  
* Note: alias names and values have to be enclosed in doubel quotes:  
`alias "name" "function;function2"`
